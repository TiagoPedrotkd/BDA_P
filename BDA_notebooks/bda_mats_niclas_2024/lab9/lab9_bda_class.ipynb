    "<b>Graphs:</b> Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically; see Graph (discrete mathematics) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered (follow this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)). Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics.\n",

    "Graph processing is important aspect of analysis that applies to a lot of use cases. Fundamentally graph theory and processing are about defining relationships between different nodes and edges. Nodes or vertices are the units while edges define the relationships between nodes. This works great for social network analysis and running algorithms like PageRank to better understand and weigh relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some business use cases could be to look at central people in social networks [who is most popular in a group of friends], importance of papers in bibliographic networks [which papers are most referenced], and of course ranking web pages.\n",

    "## PageRank\n",
    "\n",
    "For this class we will look into the page rank algorithm again but – this time – from another point of view. As you might remenber, the PageRank of a particular web page indicates its relative importance within a group of web pages. The higher the page rank, the higher up it will appear in a search result list. The importance of a page is defined by the importance of all the web pages that provide an outbound link to the web page in consideration.\n",
    " For example, say that web page X has very high relative importance. Web page X is outbounding to web page Y (webpage X links to Y); hence, web page Y will also have high importance. However, if webpage X links to many webpages, including Y, the importance of Y is lower.\n",

When following a link, without any other information, the surfer picks a link from the page at random and follows that one. When “doing something else,” the surfer moves to a random page on the web and restarts the surfing. To generate a simple model, we assume both of these behaviors even though they may seem ridiculous. When stated mathematically, this random surfer model is called a Markov chain because the behavior of the surfer only depends upon the current page and not the history of previous pages. Let α be the probability that the surfer follows a link; then 1 − α is the probability that the surfer “does something else.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that we let the surfer run for a long time. The PageRank of a page is the probability of finding the surfer at that page as the surfing time becomes infinite. A key assumption behind PageRank is that pages where we are more likely to find the random surfer are more important pages and thus we can view the PageRank as a measure of the page’s importance.\n",

    "<b> Motif </b> All networks, including biological networks, social networks, technological networks (e.g., computer networks and electrical circuits) and more, can be represented as graphs, which include a wide variety of subgraphs. One important local property of networks are so-called network motifs, which are defined as recurrent and statistically significant sub-graphs or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network motifs are sub-graphs that repeat themselves in a specific network or even among various networks. Each of these sub-graphs, defined by a particular pattern of interactions between vertices, may reflect a framework in which particular functions are achieved efficiently. Indeed, motifs are of notable importance largely because they may reflect functional properties. They have recently gathered much attention as a useful concept to uncover structural design principles of complex networks. Although network motifs may provide a deep insight into the network’s functional abilities, their detection is computationally challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphFrame motif finding uses a simple Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for expressing structural queries. For example, graph.find(\"(a)-[e]->(b); (b)-[e2]->(a)\") will search for pairs of vertices a,b connected by edges in both directions. It will return a DataFrame of all such structures in the graph, with columns for each of the named elements (vertices or edges) in the motif. In this case, the returned columns will be “a, b, e, e2.”\n",
    "\n",
    "DSL for expressing structural patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic unit of a pattern is an edge. For example, \"(a)-[e]->(b)\" expresses an edge e from vertex a to vertex b. Note that vertices are denoted by parentheses (a), while edges are denoted by square brackets [e].\n",
    "\n",
    "A pattern is expressed as a union of edges. Edge patterns can be joined with semicolons. Motif \"(a)-[e]->(b); (b)-[e2]->(c)\" specifies two edges from a to b to c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a pattern, names can be assigned to vertices and edges. For example, \"(a)-[e]->(b)\" has three named elements: vertices a,b and edge e. These names serve two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  The names can identify common elements among edges. For example, \"(a)-[e]->(b); (b)-[e2]->(c)\" specifies that the same vertex b is the destination of edge e and source of edge e2.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  The names are used as column names in the result DataFrame. If a motif contains named vertex a, then the result DataFrame will contain a column “a” which is a StructType with sub-fields equivalent to the schema (columns) of GraphFrame.vertices. Similarly, an edge e in a motif will produce a column “e” in the result DataFrame with sub-fields equivalent to the schema (columns) of GraphFrame.edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Be aware that names do not identify distinct elements: two elements with different names may refer to the same graph element. For example, in the motif \"(a)-[e]->(b); (b)-[e2]->(c)\", the names a and c could refer to the same vertex. To restrict named elements to be distinct vertices or edges, use post-hoc filters such as resultDataframe.filter(\"a.id != c.id\").\n",
    "\n",
    "It is acceptable to omit names for vertices or edges in motifs when not needed. E.g., \"(a)-[]->(b)\" expresses an edge between vertices a,b but does not assign a name to the edge. There will be no column for the anonymous edge in the result DataFrame. Similarly, \"(a)-[e]->()\" indicates an out-edge of vertex a but does not name the destination vertex. These are called anonymous vertices and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "An edge can be negated to indicate that the edge should not be present in the graph. E.g., \"(a)-[]->(b); !(b)-[]->(a)\" finds edges from a to b for which there is no edge from b to a.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information: http://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/user-guide.html#motif-finding\n",
    "\n",
    "A worked example is available here with a few motif patterns applied. They use Scala as opposed to Python but you can ignore the code outside of the patterns they use: http://www.twesdai.com/2017/09/15/motif-analysis-using-apache-spark-graphframes/\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a simple example to try to make how this works clear. Imagine we might want to find all people that have a common friend with person 1, but are not friends with person one. First we find all common friends. Take a look at the find method, we look for where a is connected to b, b connected to c, but a not connected to c. In the next step we filter for results with person 1."

A station where trips end at but rarely start from. This station will end up with a lot of excess bikes that will need to be re-distributed."
